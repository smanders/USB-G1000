================
Prerequisites
================

Prepare to build the driver, you need the Linux kernel sources installed on the
build machine, and make sure that the version of the running kernel must match
the installed kernel sources. If you don't have the kernel sources, you can get
it from www.kernel.org or contact to your Linux distributor. If you don't know
how to do, please refer to KERNEL-HOWTO.

Note1: Please make sure the kernel is built with one of the "Support for
       Host-side, EHCI, OHCI, or UHCI" option support.

Note2: Please make sure the kernel is built with "Multi-purpose USB Networking
       Framework" option support.

Note3: Check the necessary header file "usbnet.h" for building this driver.
       Without this file, the driver compilation will fail and encounter
       hundreds of errors all throuhout the souces. This file was located in
       different directory according to your kernel version:

       1. Linux kernel versions from 2.6.14 to 2.6.21
          /Path-to-your-Linux-kernel-sources/drivers/usb/net/usbnet.h

       2. Linux kernel versions from 2.6.22 to 2.6.24
          /Path-to-your-Linux-kernel-sources/drivers/net/usb/usbnet.h

       3. Linux kernel versions from 2.6.25 and later
          /Path-to-your-Linux-kernel-sources/include/linux/usb/usbnet.h


================
Getting Start
================

1. Extract the compressed driver source file to your template directory by the
   following command:

	[root@localhost template]# tar -xf DRIVER_SOURCE_PACKAGE.tar.bz2

2. Now, the driver source files should be extracted under the current directory.
   Executing the following command to compile the driver:
 
	[root@localhost template]# make
			
3. If the compilation is well, the asix.ko will be created under the current
   directory.
 
4. If you want to use modprobe command to mount the driver, executing the
   following command to install the driver into your Linux:

	[root@localhost template]# make install


================
Usage
================

1. If you want to load the driver manually, go to the driver directory and
   execute the following commands:

	[root@localhost anywhere]# modprobe usbnet
	[root@localhost template]# insmod asix.ko

2. If you had installed the driver during driver compilation, then you can use
   the following command to load the driver automatically.

	[root@localhost anywhere]# modprobe asix

If you want to unload the driver, just executing the following command:

	[root@localhost anywhere]# rmmod asix
	[root@localhost anywhere]# rmmod usbnet
